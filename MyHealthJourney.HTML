        <h4>MY PATH TO BETTER HEALTH</h4>
        <p>
            In early 2021, I decided to make a life-style change and found that the benefits of eating well were truly the best way to gain control of my mental health.
            At the end of 2020, I was facing extreme depression. There was a wide range of factors contributing to this low feeling - <em>the<span class = "pandemic"> pandemic</span> was a huge one.</em>
            I was consuming a double bottle of pinot noir <em>alone</em> almost every night of the week. Combined with terrible eating habits, and no energy or desire to ever leave my house, I was rapidly hitting the lowest point of my life.
            <span class = "change">I knew something needed to change.</span>
            I started with my diet - I decided to focus on eating more whole and raw foods and thinking about food as fuel for my body. "You are what you eat" is such a clich√©, but I did find this to be so true once I consciously focused on how the foods I consumed made me feel.
            I started this journey as most people do - "to lose weight" but, I quickly learned that this was so much more than that for me. I am now aware of how my mental health is deeply affected by what I consume.
            Today I am in a much better state of mind - I have learned how to nuture my body to feel the best that I can. I am proud of my progress and I am able to dream so much bigger for myself than I ever thought possible. <br /> The left photo is from October 2020 - I weighed <strong>240lbs</strong>.<br /> The right photo is from April 2022 - I weigh <strong>160lbs</strong>.
